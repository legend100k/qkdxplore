# Photon Animation Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a photon-by-photon transmission animation in all simulation modes of the BB84 protocol application. The animation is displayed on the left side below the progress bar in each simulation mode.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Reusable Component
- Created `PhotonTransmissionAnimation.tsx` component that can be reused across all simulation modes
- Component includes Alice and Bob labels, photon movement animation, and eavesdropping indicator

### 2. Local Simulation Mode (SimulationSection.tsx)
- Integrated the new component to replace the inline implementation
- Animation is displayed during the "Photon transmitted" step of the simulation
- Maintains existing eavesdropping visualization when applicable

### 3. Qiskit Integration Mode (QiskitIntegration.tsx)
- Added progress tracking and photon position state
- Implemented continuous photon animation during API requests
- Added progress bar and photon animation display while protocol is running

### 4. Experiments Mode (ExperimentsSection.tsx)
- Added photon position state to track animation
- Implemented continuous photon animation during experiment execution
- Added photon animation display in the running experiment section

## Technical Approach
1. **Consistent Styling**: Used the same visual design across all modes with quantum-themed colors
2. **Performance**: Animation uses CSS transitions for smooth performance
3. **Reusability**: Created a single component that can be imported and used across all modes
4. **State Management**: Properly integrated with existing state management in each component

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/PhotonTransmissionAnimation.tsx` - New component
2. `src/components/SimulationSection.tsx` - Integrated new component
3. `src/components/QiskitIntegration.tsx` - Added animation and progress tracking
4. `src/components/ExperimentsSection.tsx` - Added animation and progress tracking

## Verification
- All changes build successfully without errors
- Animation is consistently displayed in all three simulation modes
- Existing functionality remains intact
- Visual styling is consistent with the quantum theme of the application

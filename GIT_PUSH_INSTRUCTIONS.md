# Instructions to Push Your Changes

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
1. Git installed on your system
2. Proper authentication set up with your remote repository (SSH key or credentials)
3. Network connectivity to your remote repository

## Method 1: Using the Automated Script

Run the automated script that was created for you:

```bash
cd /home/tejasn27/quantum-bb84-playground-52
./git_push_script.sh
```

## Method 2: Manual Git Commands

Alternatively, you can run the commands manually:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/tejasn27/quantum-bb84-playground-52

# Stage the modified files
git add src/components/AnalysisSection.tsx
git add src/components/ExperimentsSection.tsx
git add src/components/ReportsSection.tsx
git add src/components/SimulationSection.tsx

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add axis labels to all charts for improved data visualization

- Added X-axis and Y-axis labels to all charts in the application
- Enhanced user understanding of data visualization
- Improved educational value of the BB84 protocol demonstration
- Implemented dynamic labels that adapt to different experiment types"

# Push to the remote repository
git push origin main
```

## What Gets Committed

Only the core application files will be committed with this script:
- `src/components/AnalysisSection.tsx`
- `src/components/ExperimentsSection.tsx`
- `src/components/ReportsSection.tsx`
- `src/components/SimulationSection.tsx`

The following additional files were created during development but are NOT staged by default:
- Documentation files (CHANGES_SUMMARY.md, FINAL_SUMMARY.md, TASK_COMPLETION.md)
- Utility script (verify_changes.sh)
- The git push script itself (git_push_script.sh)

If you want to include these additional files, uncomment the relevant lines in the git_push_script.sh file.

## Verification

After pushing, you can verify the changes were successful by:
1. Checking your remote repository to confirm the commits appear
2. Verifying that the charts now display axis labels when the application is run

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication problems**: Make sure your SSH keys are set up correctly or use HTTPS with credentials
2. **Permission denied**: Ensure you have write permissions to the repository
3. **Merge conflicts**: If the remote has changes you don't have locally, you may need to pull first:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
4. **Network issues**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings

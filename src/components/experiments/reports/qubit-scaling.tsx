  theory: "The BB84 protocol leverages the unique properties of quantum bits, or qubits, which is the fundamental unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit, which is definitively 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously, represented as |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex probability amplitudes (|α|² + |β|² = 1).\nIn BB84, information is encoded onto qubits using two non-orthogonal bases:\nThe Rectilinear Basis (+): |0⟩₊ = |→⟩ (Horizontal polarization), |1⟩₊ = |↑⟩ (Vertical polarization)\nThe Diagonal Basis (×): |0⟩ₓ = |↗⟩ = (|→⟩ + |↑⟩)/√2 (45° polarization), |1⟩ₓ = |↖⟩ = (|→⟩ - |↑⟩)/√2 (135° polarization)\nThe protocol's security is not mathematical but physical, relying on three core principles:\nMeasurement Disturbance: Measuring a quantum system irrevocably collapses its state. If Bob measures a qubit in a basis different from the one Alice used to prepare it, the result is random (50% chance of |0⟩ or |1⟩), and the original information is lost.\nNo-Cloning Theorem: It is impossible to create an identical copy (clone) of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. An evesdropper, Eve, cannot perfectly intercept, copy, and resend a qubit without altering the original.\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Certain pairs of physical properties (like polarization in different bases) cannot be simultaneously known with perfect accuracy. This makes it impossible to measure a quantum state in multiple ways without introducing errors.\nThese properties ensure that any attempt to gain information about the key introduces detectable anomalies.",
  
  procedure: "1. Run BB84 simulations with different numbers of qubits (10-50)\n2. Maintain constant noise and eavesdropping parameters\n3. Measure key length and statistical security improvements\n4. Analyze scalability and practical implementation considerations"

  theory: "Quantum channels in practical implementations suffer from various noise sources including photon loss, detector dark counts, and environmental interference. The BB84 protocol's security relies on the assumption of a quantum channel, but real-world implementations must account for noise effects. This experiment examines how channel noise affects error rates and key generation efficiency.",
  
  procedure: "1. Set up BB84 simulation with varying noise levels from 0% to 20%\n2. Run simulation with 30 qubits for each noise level\n3. Record error rates and key generation rates\n4. Analyze the relationship between noise and protocol performance\n5. Generate graphs and statistical analysis"

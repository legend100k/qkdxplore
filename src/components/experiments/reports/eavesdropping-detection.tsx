  theory: "The fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that measurement disturbs quantum states forms the basis of eavesdropping detection in BB84. When Eve intercepts and measures photons, she inevitably introduces errors that Alice and Bob can detect through basis comparison and error rate analysis. This experiment quantifies the relationship between eavesdropping attempts and detectable errors.",
  
  procedure: "1. Configure BB84 simulation with varying eavesdropping rates\n2. Run experiments with different interception probabilities\n3. Measure error rate changes and detection capabilities\n4. Analyze security implications and detection thresholds"

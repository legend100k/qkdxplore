Aim: To investigate how the number of transmitted qubits affects key length and statistical security in the BB84 protocol.
Objective: To understand the relationship between sample size (number of qubits) and the reliability of security analysis.
Apparatus: Q-Xplore Virtual Lab

Theory:
In BB84, Alice and Bob transmit quantum bits (qubits) using randomly chosen polarization bases. Due to the random basis selection:
- Only ~50% of qubits have matching bases (basis reconciliation)
- These matching qubits form the "sifted key"
- The sifted key length â (Total qubits transmitted) / 2

Statistical Security:
The security of QKD depends on accurately estimating the QBER from a sample of the sifted key. With more qubits:
1. Larger sample size â More reliable QBER estimation
2. Statistical fluctuations decrease as ~1/âN (where N = number of qubits)
3. Hoeffding's inequality bounds the confidence: The true QBER is within Îµ of measured QBER with probability 1-Î´, where Îµ â 1/âN

Security Threshold:
- QBER < 11%: Key is secure (after error correction and privacy amplification)
- QBER â¥ 11%: Key is compromised; abort protocol

Key Length vs. Security Trade-off:
- More qubits â Longer final key (useful for encrypting more data)
- More qubits â Better statistical certainty (more confident in security analysis)
- Fewer qubits â Faster transmission but less reliable security guarantees

Procedure:
Set eavesdropper = OFF, Channel Noise = LOW (to isolate the effect of qubit number)
Vary the number of qubits from small (10) to large (100)
Observe how key length and statistical security improve with more qubits
Note that QBER remains stable (intrinsic floor ~1.5-2%) regardless of qubit count

Expected Observation:
- Key length increases linearly with number of qubits
- QBER remains constant (no eavesdropping, low noise)
- Statistical confidence improves with more qubits

- Average key rate: ${avgKeyRate.toFixed(1)}% (expected ~50% due to basis reconciliation)
- Average QBER: ${avgQBER.toFixed(2)}% (remains constant across all qubit counts)

Relationship Analysis:
${isLinear ? 
  `â Key length scales linearly with number of qubits, as expected.
  This confirms that approximately 50% of transmitted qubits survive basis reconciliation to form the sifted key.` :
  `â  Key length scaling shows some deviation from perfect linearity.
  This may be due to statistical fluctuations in basis matching at small sample sizes.`
}

Statistical Security:
- With ${minQubits} qubits: Statistical uncertainty is higher (~${(100 / Math.sqrt(minQubits)).toFixed(1)}%)
- With ${maxQubits} qubits: Statistical uncertainty is lower (~${(100 / Math.sqrt(maxQubits)).toFixed(1)}%)
- Larger sample sizes provide more confident security guarantees

Practical Implications:
1. More qubits â Longer encryption key (can secure more data)
2. More qubits â Better statistical confidence in QBER measurement
3. The QBER (${avgQBER.toFixed(2)}%) remains stable regardless of qubit count, confirming that channel conditions, not sample size, determine error rate
4. For real-world QKD: Balance between transmission time (more qubits = longer) and security confidence

Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates that while the number of qubits directly determines the final key length (~50% of transmitted qubits), it does not affect the QBER itself. The QBER is determined by channel noise and eavesdropping, not by sample size. However, more qubits provide better statistical confidence when estimating the QBER and making security decisions.`;

Aim: To investigate how noise in the quantum channel affects the security of the BB84 protocol by increasing the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER).
Objective: To isolate and observe the impact of channel noise on the QBER.

Theory: Channel noise stems from physical imperfections like photon scattering, polarization drift, and detector dark counts. Unlike photon loss, noise directly causes bit errors: Bob detects a photon but records the wrong bit value. This directly increases the QBER. A high QBER can render the key insecure, even without an evesdropper, as it becomes impossible to distinguish these errors from a malicious attack.

Aim: To establish a baseline for the BB84 protocol's performance under ideal, secure conditions.
Objective: To observe the key generation process and resulting QBER when the quantum channel is secure.
Apparatus: Q-Xplore Virtual Lab
Theory:
This experiment establishes the optimal operating conditions for the BB84 protocol. In the complete absence of an evesdropper, the only factors affecting the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) are the inherent channel noise and system imperfections, as described in Experiment 2. Under well-controlled laboratory conditions with high-quality components, this intrinsic QBER can be very low, often below 2%.
The process proceeds as follows:
Quantum Transmission: Alice sends a sequence of qubits, each randomly prepared in one of the two bases.
Quantum Measurement: Bob independently and randomly chooses a basis for each incoming qubit and measures it.
Sifting: Alice and Bob publicly communicate the bases they used for each qubit (but not the bit values) over a classical channel. They discard all bits where their bases did not match. The remaining bits form the sifted key.
Error Estimation: They compare a random subset of the sifted key to calculate the QBER. A low QBER confirms the channel is secure.
Key Finalization: The remaining portion of the sifted key is then processed through error correction (to fix the few remaining errors) and privacy amplification (to reduce any partial information a potential evesdropper might have) to produce a final, identical, and perfectly secret key.
This scenario demonstrates the protocol's maximum efficiency and serves as a control to identify the disruptive effects of an evesdropper.
Procedure:

Aim: To demonstrate the detection of an evesdropper (Eve) using the BB84 protocol.
Objective: To observe how Eve's interception attempts disturb the quantum states and significantly increase the QBER.
Apparatus: Q-Xplore Virtual Lab
Theory:
This experiment demonstrates the core security feature of BB84: the detectable disruption caused by any interception attempt. The most straightforward attack is the intercept-resend attack:
Interception: Eve intercepts the qubit sent by Alice.
Measurement: She randomly chooses a basis (rectilinear or diagonal) to measure it. She has a 50% chance of choosing the wrong basis.
Disturbance: If she chooses the wrong basis, the qubit's state collapses randomly. She records this random result as the bit value.
Resending: To hide her presence, she must send a new qubit to Bob prepared in the state she measured.
This action introduces errors. The probability that Eve chooses the wrong basis is 1/2. If she chooses wrong, she sends the wrong state to Bob. However, Bob also has a 50% chance of choosing the wrong basis for his measurement. The overall probability that an error is introduced for a bit that Eve tampered with is calculated as:
P(Eve chooses wrong basis) = 1/2
P(Bob gets wrong bit | Eve was wrong) = 1/2
Therefore, P(Error) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%
Thus, Eve's activity raises the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) to approximately 25%, which is far above the typical tolerable threshold of ~11%. This dramatic and predictable increase is an unambiguous signature of eavesdropping, forcing Alice and Bob to discard the compromised key.
Procedure:
Go to the Q-Xplore Virtual Lab simulator.

Aim: To analyze how increasing the transmission distance impacts the efficiency and performance of the BB84 protocol.
Objective: To observe the relationship between distance, photon loss (key rate), and error rate (QBER).
Apparatus: Q-Xplore Virtual Lab
Theory: The primary effect of distance is exponential photon loss (attenuation), which drastically reduces the number of photons reaching Bob and thus the final key rate. Furthermore, over longer distances, effects like polarization drift have more time to occur, which can also cause errors and lead to a slight increase in the QBER alongside the major issue of loss.

Set Distance = SHORT. Run the simulation. Record the QBER and Final Key Length. This is your baseline.
Set Distance = MEDIUM. Run the simulation. Record the QBER and Final Key Length.

Observation:
[Note: The Final Key Length should drop dramatically with distance. The QBER may also see a slight increase. This shows distance causes loss and can worsen errors.]

Objective: To demonstrate that photon loss reduces the key rate but does not directly increase the QBER.
Theory: It is crucial to distinguish between Photon Loss and Bit Errors.
Photon Loss: A photon is sent but not detected. This reduces the raw number of bits, lowering the key rate, but it does not increase the QBER (a lost photon isn't an error; it's just missing data).
Bit Errors: A photon is detected but its value is wrong. This increases the QBER and compromises security.
An evesdropper causes errors. Channel noise causes errors. Distance causes loss (which can lead to errors indirectly). This experiment isolates the pure effect of loss.
Procedure:
Set evesdropper = OFF, Channel Noise = LOW (to ensure no errors are introduced).
Find a "Photon Loss" or "Attenuation" parameter. If not available, use Distance = LONG.
Set loss to HIGH (or use max distance). Run the simulation.
